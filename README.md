# godot-config

My Godot 3 editor configuration files

## Config location

As of Godot version 3.x, on Linux, the config files are located in `$HOME/config/godot`

To use my config, simply download `editor_settings-3.tres` from this repo and copy it into the directory specified above.

## Features

+ 1.5x scaling
+ Alien theme
+ External code editor (VSCode in my case)
+ Custom interface font (Inter Medium, make sure to download the latest version of the font and put it in `$HOME/.fonts`). Filename is named `Inter-Medium.otf`, but you should change this to whatever your favorite font is and where exactly it is on your system
+ Custom code font (kinda useless as I'm using an external text editor)
+ 0 width borders because borders are kind of useless in the UI

**NOTE:** The integrated text editor only shows up if you don't have an external text editor set up.
Also, it doesn't have vim bindings and the shortcut to comment/uncomment code is `CTRL+K` and not `CTRL+/` as I'm used to.
